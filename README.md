Implementation of [1] written in MATLAB and C++.

![Example](examples/example.png)

The code uses the roof duality code from [2].

The code has been tested on:
* Windows 7, MATLAB 2015a, Visual Studio 2013.
* Ubuntu 14.04, MATLAB 2015a, GCC 4.8.2.


Getting started 
----------
The code requires [https://github.com/petters/spii](SPII). 


#### Windows 
Update include/compile_script.m with the correct folders to Eigen and SPII.

#### Examples
A good place to start is with the two scripts:  
* examples/example_2D.m
* examples/example_3D.m

#### Code authors
* Johannes Ul√©n
* Carl Olsson
